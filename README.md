# Hugo things
All things Hugo, probably mostly notes

### The basic idea
- Hugo themes for quick development of static sites
- Github pages for free hosting
  - Each client uses their own account?
  - Create the repo in my account, make private, fork (or at least clone) on their account?
- Some DNS service to register domain names
- Add CNAME files to pages repo for custom domain

### Things I need to research
- Customizing Hugo themes
- Best DNS service to use?
- Registering custom domain names to Github pages
